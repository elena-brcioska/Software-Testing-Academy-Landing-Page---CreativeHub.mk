<h1>Landing Page for Data Analytics Academy @ CreativeHub - Educational Company</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I had the opportunity to develop the Landing Page for the Software Testing Academy at CreativeHub.
<br />
For this website I worked back to back with a Ux Ui Designer, and developed the project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and frameworks like Bootstrap, AOS Library, and GlideJs.
<br />
The webpage is made responsive for all viewports


<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Javascript</b>
- <b>CSS</b>
- <b>HTML</b>
- <b>Bootstrap</b> 
- <b>AOS</b>
- <b>GlideJs</b>
